# SINOPE OS

This is a simple experimental operating system I created for studying
microkernel based operating systems. Features will be added from time
to time. This is not intended to become anything useful in the future.

In order to compile the system, you are required to use a proper cross
compiling toolchain (gcc, binutils) for one of the supported target
architectures (ix86-elf with x >= 3 only at the moment).

Features included at the moment:
 * well, it boots and prints a message to vga ;)
